Groups including the Musicians' Union are calling for an end to the \"raw deal\" faced by British performers. US acts are not faced with comparable expense and bureaucracy when visiting the UK for promotional purposes.\\n\\nNigel McCune from the Musicians' Union said British musicians are \"disadvantaged\" compared to their US counterparts. A sponsor has to make a petition on their behalf, which is a form amounting to nearly 30 pages, while musicians face tougher regulations than athletes and journalists. \"If you make a mistake on your form, you risk a five-year ban and thus the ability to further your career,\" says Mr McCune.\\n\\n\"The US is the world's biggest music market, which means something has to be done about the creaky bureaucracy,\" says Mr McCune. \"The current situation is preventing British acts from maintaining momentum and developing in the US,\" he added.\\n\\nThe Musicians' Union stance is being endorsed by the Music Managers' Forum (MMF), who say British artists face \"an uphill struggle\" to succeed in the US, thanks to the tough visa requirements, which are also seen as impractical. The MMF's general secretary James Seller said: \"Imagine if you were an orchestra from the Orkneys? Every member would have to travel to London to have their visas processed.\"\\n\\n\"The US market is seen as the holy grail and one of the benchmarks of success, and we're still going to fight to get in there. \"It's still very important, but there are other markets like Europe, India and China,\" added Mr Seller. A Department for Media, Culture and Sport spokeswoman said: \"We're aware that people are experiencing problems, and are working with the US embassy and record industry to see what we can do about it.\" A US Embassy spokesman said: \"We are aware that entertainers require visas for time-specific visas and are doing everything we can to process those applications speedily.\" \"We are aware of the importance of cultural exchange and we will do our best to facilitate that,\" he added.\\n\n",

', 'Each cell-cultured meat firm is developing detailed information on its own eventual commercial production methods for making cell-cultured meat. ', 'Specifically, FDA and USDA officials said they have limited information on cell-cultured meat production methods and products and need more in order to regulate this new food. ', 'According to FDA officials and representatives from one cell-cultured meat firm, it is likely that some firms will use genetic engineering in their commercial cell-cultured meat production methods. ', 'Some studies and stakeholders we interviewed, including representatives from cell-cultured meat firms, said that the high production cost of cell- cultured meat is a key industry challenge. ', 'According to representatives from some cell-cultured meat firms, initial cell-cultured meat products most likely will not be composed entirely of cell- cultured meat but, rather, a mixture of cell-cultured meat and other ingredients such as binding, flavoring ingredients, and plant-based materials used in conventional food products. ', 'However, representatives from cell-cultured meat firms stated that they aim to produce products that contain more cell-cultured meat than other ingredients. ', 'In 2018, FDA and USDA began taking steps to collaborate on the regulatory oversight of cell-cultured meat through several mechanisms: a joint public meeting, an interagency agreement, and three working groups. ', 'FDA and USDA could more fully incorporate leading practices for collaboration in their interagency agreement and working groups. ', 'We found that the interagency agreement for oversight of cell-cultured meat partially incorporates all seven leading practices for collaboration. ', 'As the agencies continue to collaborate on their shared oversight of cell- cultured meat, by more fully incorporating all seven leading practices for collaboration into their interagency agreement, they will be better positioned to address potential fragmentation in their efforts to ensure the safety of the food supply as cell-cultured meat products near commercialization and entry into the marketplace. ', 'The agencies’ 2019 agreement to share oversight of cell-cultured meat creates a new relationship between FDA and USDA, since the agencies will oversee different stages of the production of the same food and hand off oversight at a certain point in that production. ', 'In this context, some industry representatives and other stakeholders have expressed concerns about potential fragmentation or overlap in oversight of cell-cultured meat, such as could occur during the harvest phase of cell-cultured meat production when FDA hands off its oversight to USDA.

', 'shows the program’s planned end to developmental testing and planned timeframes for operational testing for 2012 and the past four years and the delays the program has realized each year since the program was re-baselined in 2012. ', 'Resolution of deficiencies:', 'First, before the program could begin operational testing, it had to resolve critical deficiencies with the aircraft that were identified during development testing. ', 'In June 2018, we recommended that the Secretary of Defense direct the F-35 program to resolve all these deficiencies before the program’s October 2019 full-rate production decision. ', 'Of the 23 operational test aircraft, the program replaced the fuel tubes on 18 aircraft by the start of operational testing in December 2018, which contributed to the 3-month delay. ', 'In June 2018, we recommended that the F-35 program identify what steps it needs to take to ensure the F-35 aircraft meet R&M requirements before each variant reaches maturity and update its R&M Improvement Program (RMIP)—DOD’s action plan for prioritizing and funding R&M improvement projects—with these steps. ', 'The F-35 program office has estimated that implementing all of the identified improvement projects currently contained in its RMIP could result in potential life cycle cost savings of over $9.2 billion by improving the F-35’s R&M. ', 'With development of the baseline program complete, the program is transitioning to early development and testing for modernization efforts known as Block 4, which are expected to cost about $10.5 billion. ', 'The F- 35 program plans to award Block 4 development contracts starting in May 2019, before completing a business case—a baseline cost and schedule estimate to track the program’s performance going forward. ', 'The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 required DOD to submit a report containing certain elements of an acquisition program baseline—in essence, a full program business case—to include the cost, schedule, and performance information for Block 4. ', 'DOD’s report to Congress also outlined the F-35 program office’s new development approach to deliver Block 4 capabilities—new requirements beyond the baseline aircraft capabilities to address evolving threats. ', 'According to program officials, as of December 2018, the program has executed contract actions valued over $1.4 billion to establish testing facilities and support early Block 4 development of capabilities the program plans to deliver through 2024. ', 'The F-35 program plans to award Block 4 development contracts without knowledge of the effort’s full cost or the maturity of critical technologies. ', 'Specifically, test officials stated the F-35 program office has not provided details on which capabilities are planned for each testing development cycle making it difficult to execute testing. ', 'According to CAPE officials, they will provide the independent cost estimate between October and December 2019 to support the program’s full-rate production decision, but this would occur several months after the program plans to award the Block 4 development contracts. ', '(Recommendation 4)', 'The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the F-35 program office completes its business case, at least for the initial Block 4 capabilities under development, before initiating additional development work, to include: an independent cost estimate; an approved test and evaluation master plan which addresses resources, aircraft shortfalls, and funding; and an independent technology readiness assessment. ', 'DOD officials did not concur with our recommendation that the F-35 program office complete its business case before initiating additional development work. ', 'DOD stated that the F-35 program office has adequate cost, schedule, and technical maturity knowledge to begin the development of initial Block 4 capabilities.
